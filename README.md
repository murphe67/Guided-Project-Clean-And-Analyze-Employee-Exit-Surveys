# Guided-Project-Clean-And-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys
DataQuest Guided Project on Data Cleaning and Visualisation

This guided project from Dataquest analyses employee exit surveys from the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and  Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

The aim of the analysis is to discover:
Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
What about employees who have been there longer?
Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
What about older employees?
